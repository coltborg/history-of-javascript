# fed-tooling-slideshow
Introduction to Node, NPM, Grunt, and Bower. Just the basics. Built with impress.js

Funnily enough, in order to really view this slideshow it its full glory, 
you need to install 2 of the 4 dependencies that this slideshow teaches you to install.
I guess for that, I'll say that this repo is aimed at teachers and the contents of it,
intended for students.

1. Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Open your terminal and enter `npm install -g bower`
3. Clone the repository and `cd` to project root
4. Run `bower install`
